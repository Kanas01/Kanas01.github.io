  we present a collaborative human-ML teaming workflow that seamlessly integrates visual cluster analysis and active learning to assist domain experts in labeling medical text with high efficiency. An innovative embedding network is introduced to incorporates expert insights to generate task-specific embeddings for medical texts. We integrate the workflow and embedding network into a visual analytics tool named KMTLabeler, equipped with coordinated multi-level views and interactions.
