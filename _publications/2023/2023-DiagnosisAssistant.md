  We present DiagnosisAssistant, a visual analytics system that leverages historical medical records as a proxy for multimodal modeling and visualization to enhance the learning experience of interns and novice physicians. The system employs elaborately designed visualizations to explore different modality data, offer diagnostic interpretive hints based on the constructed model, and enable comparative analyses of specific patients.
