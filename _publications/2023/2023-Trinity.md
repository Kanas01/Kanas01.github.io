  We introduce Trinity, a hybrid mobile-centric delivery support system that provides guidance for multichannel delivery on-the-fly. On the desktop side, Trinity facilitates script refinement and offers customizable delivery support based on large language models (LLMs). Based on the desktop configuration, Trinity App enables a remote mobile visual control, multi-level speech pace modulation, and integrated delivery prompts for synchronized delivery.
