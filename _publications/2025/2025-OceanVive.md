  We formulated refined topologies for data, requirements, and solutions. We propose conceptualizing the connections between requirements, data, and solutions through knowledge graphs and utilizing solution paths to encapsulate fundamental problem-solving knowledge in visual analytics research. Through the consolidation of solution paths into a graph and analyzing their interconnections, we discerned a subset of problem-driven design patterns that demonstrated the efficacy of our approach.
