    I am with an open mind to explore my research potential in diverse avenues during my MCs study. Thus, I have dived into areas of Visual Analytics, Hybrid User Interface, Theories/Methodologies, and VR/AR. 
    My current research interest in doctoral study converges towards - <u>Mitigating tensions between humans and wearable agents in pervasive contexts through the integration of visualization and intelligence.</u> Never hesitate to reach out if you see collaboration potentials!

    I enjoy citypop and the mixed style of blues, soul, jazz, rock, and R&B music. I also like playing video games and reading novels that blend psychology and philosophy.
    I am a fan of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC9OXNkUKmf3bUx8N9l8jM2w">Izumi Sakai</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reiko_Ohara">Reiko Ohara</a>.
