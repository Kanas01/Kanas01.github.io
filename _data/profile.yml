    I am with an open mind to explore my research potential in diverse avenues during my MCs study. Thus, I have dived into areas of Visual Analytics, Hybrid User Interface, Theories/Methodologies, and VR/AR. 
    My current research interest centers around - <u>Facilitating enhanced working and living with wearable agents through the integration of visualization and intelligence.</u>
